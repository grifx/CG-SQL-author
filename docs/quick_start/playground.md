## CQL Playground
While we do not offer an interactive REPL environment, we have bootstrapped an environment to run simple CQL programs in the `repl` folder of our repository. You can run it by doing this from the CQL repository:

```bash
$ cd sources/repl
$ ./go.sh
```

By default, you'll get this output:
```
../out/cql ready
CQL Mini App Thingy
Hello from CQL.
Edit as you please
```

`go.sh` runs the `go()` stored procedure defined in `go.sql`. You can experiment with the CQL language by editing the `go.sql` file, as you please.

The contents of `go.sh` also offers a basic demonstration of how CQL should be typically used to transpile files into a C executable.

## Query Plan Playground
Within the same `repl` directory, we have a script that demonstrates [CQL's query plan generation feature](../user_guide/15_query_plan_generation.md) with `go.sql`.

Run this script in the `/repl` directory of the CQL repository:
```bash
$ cd repl
$ ./go_query_plan.sh
```

The script will generate the output of `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` of the SQL statements used in `go.sql`.

```json
{
"alerts" : {

},
"plans" : [
  {
   "id" : 1,
   "query" : "INSERT INTO my_table(str) VALUES(\"Hello from CQL.\"), (\"Edit as you please.\")",
   "stats" : [
      ["SCAN", 1]
    ],
   "plan" : "QUERY PLAN\n|..SCAN 2 CONSTANT ROWS"
  },
  {
   "id" : 2,
   "query" : "SELECT *\n  FROM my_table",
   "stats" : [
      ["SCAN", 1]
    ],
   "plan" : "QUERY PLAN\n|..SCAN TABLE my_table"
  }
]
}
```

You can use something like [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) to filter the parts you want. For example:

```bash
$ ./go_query_plan.sh | jq '.plans[] | {query:.query, plan:.plan}'
```

Which would yield:

```
{
  "query": "INSERT INTO my_table(str) VALUES(\"Hello from CQL.\"), (\"Edit as you please.\")",
  "plan": "QUERY PLAN\n|..SCAN 2 CONSTANT ROWS"
}
{
  "query": "SELECT *\n  FROM my_table",
  "plan": "QUERY PLAN\n|..SCAN TABLE my_table"
}
```

## Fully Online Playground
Contributor [mingodad](https://github.com/mingodad) created this wonder, all online using the CQL Amalgam, plus WASM and LUA to create a 100% [in-your-browser playground](https://mingodad.github.io/CG-SQL-Lua-playground/).
